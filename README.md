# My build of dwm (shameless fork of [Luke Smith's](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz) build)

## Patches and features

- Extra bloated ft. polybar (thanks to [polybar-dwm-module](https://github.com/mihirlad55/polybar-dwm-module)).
- Reads xresources colors/variables (i.e. works with `pywal`, etc.).
- scratchpad: Accessible with mod+shift+enter.
- New layouts: bstack, fibonacci, deck, centered master and more. All bound to keys `super+(shift+)t/y/u/i`.
- True fullscreen (`super+f`) and prevents focus shifting.
- Windows can be made sticky (`super+s`).
- stacker: Move windows up the stack manually (`super-K/J`).
- shiftview: Cycle through tags (`super+g/;`).
- vanitygaps: Gaps allowed across all layouts.
- swallow patch: if a program run from a terminal would make it inoperable, it temporarily takes its place to save space.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/hearthill/dwm
cd dwm
sudo make install
```

## Please install `libxft-bgra`!

This build of dwm does not block color emoji in the status/info bar, so you must install [libxft-bgra](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libxft-bgra/) from the AUR, which fixes a libxft color emoji rendering problem, otherwise dwm will crash upon trying to render one. Hopefully this fix will be in all libxft soon enough.
